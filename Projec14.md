What is Continuous Integration?
In software engineering, Continuous Integration (CI) is a practice of merging all developers’ working copies to a shared mainline (e.g., Git Repository or some other version control system) several times per day. Frequent merges reduce chances of any conflicts in code and allow to run tests more often to avoid massive rework if something goes wrong. This principle can be formulated as Commit early, push often.

The general idea behind multiple commits is to avoid what is generally considered as Merge Hell or Integration hell. When a new developer joins a new project, he or she must create a copy of the main codebase by starting a new feature branch from the mainline to develop his own features (in some organization or team, this could be called a develop, main or master branch). If there are tens of developers working on the same project, they will all have their own branches created from mainline at different points in time. Once they make a copy of the repository it starts drifting away from the mainline with every new merge of other developers’ codes. If this lingers on for a very long time without reconciling the code, then this will cause a lot of code conflict or Merge Hell, as rightly said. Imagine such a hell from tens of developers or worse, hundreds. So, the best thing to do, is to continuously commit & push your code to the mainline. As many times as tens times per day. With this practice, you can avoid Merge Hell or Integration hell

# CI concept is not only about committing your code. There is a general workflow, let us start it…

* Run tests locally: Before developers commit their code to a central repository, it is recommended to test the code locally. So, Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach is commonly used in combination with CI. Developers write tests for their code called unit-tests, and before they commit their work, they run their tests locally. This practice helps a team to avoid having one developer’s work-in-progress code from breaking other developers’ copy of the codebase.

* Compile code in CI: After testing codes locally, developers commit and push their work to a central repository. Rather than building the code into an executable locally, a dedicated CI server picks up the code and runs the build there. In this project we will use, already familiar to you, Jenkins as our CI server. Build happens either periodically – by polling the repository at some configured schedule, or after every commit. Having a CI server where builds run is a good practice for a team, as everyone has visibility into each commit and its corresponding builds.

* Run further tests in CI: Even though tests have been run locally by developers, it is important to run the unit-tests on the CI server as well. But, rather than focusing solely on unit-tests, there are other kinds of tests and code analysis that can be run using CI server. These are extremely critical to determining the overall quality of code being developed, how it interacts with other developers’ work, and how vulnerable it is to attacks. A CI server can use different tools for Static Code Analysis, Code Coverage Analysis, Code smells Analysis, and Compliance Analysis. In addition, it can run other types of tests such as Integration and Penetration tests. Other tasks performed by a CI server include production of code documentation from the source code and facilitate manual quality assurance (QA) testing processes.

* Deploy an artifact from CI: At this stage, the difference between CI and CD is spelt out. As you now know, CI is Continuous Integration, which is everything we have been discussing so far. CD on the other hand is Continuous Delivery which ensures that software checked into the mainline is always ready to be deployed to users. The deployment here is manually triggered after certain QA tasks are passed successfully. There is another CD known as Continuous Deployment which is also about deploying the software to the users, but rather than manual, it makes the entire process fully automated. Thus, Continuous Deployment is just one step ahead in automation than Continuous Delivery.
